Ethereum Fraud Detection: Ensemble Learning Approach<br>
<b>Overview</b><br>
This repository holds a comprehensive project focused on detecting fraudulent transactions and wallets within the Ethereum blockchain network using advanced machine learning models, particularly focusing on ensemble learning methods. The pseudonymous and decentralized nature of Ethereum, while beneficial for privacy and decentralization, has unfortunately opened doors to illicit activities, necessitating robust and efficient fraud detection systems. This project aims to address this issue by providing a well-researched and thoroughly implemented solution.
